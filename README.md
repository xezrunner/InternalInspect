# InternalInspect

A tool for querying system function results and browsing feature flags on Apple's platforms.

## ⚠️ Work-in-progress

The Packets tab (system function querying) is currently under construction, as part of reworks for feature flag support.

## Feature flag control support

**macOS**: Fully supports controlling and adding feature flags

**Other platforms (iOS, iPadOS, visionOS...)**: Can browse registered feature flags and view their states. Can **not** control feature flags, unless internal, jailbroken or exploited.
